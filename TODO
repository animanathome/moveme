MOVE ME
- shortcuts not working by default!
	- DONE
- manipulator not working by default!
	- TEMP PATCH
- make sure we update the timeline when creating keys!
	- DONE
- tutorial on how to move keys!
- channel box - set value on all selected objects! + when when keyed
	- Doesn't seem to be an issue
- key value change - set value on all selected objects
	- DONE
- needs settings menu 
	- so we can change default tangent time
		- DONE + color
	- show fps!
		- ON HOLD untill we get further control over fps
- auto key is still making keys at unwanted times!
- add option which aligns the keys
DONE - provide hotkeys for all buttons!!!
DONE - add tooltips for all buttons
DONE - add info dialog!!
DONE - new user?
DONE - file new? file local save?
DONE - fixed css conflict with firefox
DONE - zerod out body control for tiny
DONE - add spaceswitch to knees

DONE - http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/13267/how-can-i-mimic-the-frame-selected-f-camera-move-z.html
	- even though it doesn't seem to give the best of results
DONE - start at 10 even though time is set to 0?
	- setting was part of scene settings put we weren't triggering a timechange when loading that data. 
- update undo so it can keep track of multiple changes at once!!
DONE - reorder edit menu and move undo/redo up!
- update group_scroll_list to make the difference between shift and control select
	- shift select should select the items inbetween the new and the previously selected item where ctrl should remain as the current behaviour
FIXED - display joints don't seem to work when reloading a scene
DONE - need an option do toggle the rotation axis
DONE - stretching
	- added an additional joint in the asset data which we're driving in the rig. This seems to be the simplest solution.
	
DONE - setup mail -> free for 30 days ($5-10 per user, per month)
	- google apps -> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-gmail-with-your-domain-on-digitalocean
IN PROGRESS - setup ssl -> $50 per year
	- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-an-ssl-certificate-from-a-commercial-certificate-authority
- create a floating box/window collecting the different tools
- fix toolbar height - currenlty it sticks to the workspace 
DONE - Add select all
- add maya anim export
DONE - Copy/paste a number of keys
	- added 3 different functionalities
		- copy past and x amount of keys or animation curves one to one based on their attribute name
			- if no animation curves exist, they will be created
		- copy past 1 the data of 1 animation curve to another random animation curve
	UPDATE:
		- changed behaviour
			- now allows copy/past keys of all selected animation curves, looking at object, channel group and channel. Previsously we were just looking at channel group and channel).
			- we no longer create a animation curve when is doesn't exist

- remove document connect events ( to ensure moveme is killed when we leave its page)

- look at the spaceSwitch and spineControl['zero'] for the spineComponent

DONE - look at edge selection for controls ( don't just base it on bb )
- look at the matrix.compose to see how the transformations are combined
	-> animating scale
- cleanup scene evaluation 
	-> look on how often we run update matrixWorld
	-> come up with a cleaner shema of evaluating things
	-> make sure the ik leg doesn't continuesly evaluates as it does now!

MAYBE - undo keys doesn't remove the keys from the graph editor!!!
	- showstopper
		- now we delete the display (if present) when removing an anim curve. This seems to solve the particular issue we had.
- can we globally scale a character?
ON HOLD - disable front and back browser button
	- NOT RECOMMANDED: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12381563/how-to-stop-browser-back-button-using-javascript
DONE - make sure we don't put letters in the side bar
DONE - make sure we can copy paste the keys of multiple objects at the same time
DONE - make sure we can select all anim curves using shift select
	- start and end ( selects all anim curves inbetween )
- add and remove options from the file menu depending on the file mode
- do not update the position of the manipulator when updating scene...
	- rotating the tail freaks out!!!
- stretch keys
DONE - shift select keys in key view
DONE - btn-anim-home is undefined
DONE - Include edges when selected controls (makes selecting controls easier).
Add vertical lines to the controls (makes selecting them easier)
Add a visual button (gmail style) to toggle between horizontal and vertial mode

- object3D.keyAll needs to be moved to the editor level since we currently can't track the undo behavior
	- it needs to be moved or we need to return more information
		- did we created new keys? if so which ones... this might be a clear implementation
DONE - frame camera doesn't center the pivot of the camera. Moving the camera afterwards pops the camera
DONE - side view still doesn't behave properly
	- element dissapears
		- move camera
DONE - key view un-uniform scale is to senitive
DONE - add focus/frame to orthographic view
DONE - keyview... focus only on the selected keys
- all key view related methods need to be moved into this object
DONE - moving keys from multiple anim curves which have their keys on the same position give a strange double transformation type of effect
DONE - when multiple curve are displayed, one of them will have some type of double transformation going on when moving the individual keys
	- this only happens when using shift select in the key view outliner
DONE - make sure we don't can't set text in the time and range slider
DONE? - non-uniform scale + zoom doesn't work ( zoom seems to cancel out the non-uniform scale)
	- this seem to be fixed?
BETTER - fix rotation manipulator!!!
	- seems to rotate in the wrong direction at some point


NEW
- since we can have multiple scene view panels we can have multiple active cameras. Since this is currently a single object we'll have to convert it into a list.
DONE? - make sure we properly destroy the moveme when changing page
- add min - max limit to channel box
	- this is for stretch or ik/fk switch
- make sure we don't loose the selection when changing the camera
- add display for cameras (so we can more easily see where they are positioned)
ON HOLD - add camera aspect ratio frame 
- inherit builders -> insert_tiny, insert_default, insert_maxi
- fix soft ik ankle rotation
DONE - add stretch joints
DONE - fix naming for joints
- show FPS in panel as overlay
- seperate out the camera and transform control
	- just so it's like maya 
DONE - fix right foot from baby
- intro
	- make sure we all have the same spacing and style between the different canvases
- time slider - click select move doesn't work anymore???
- make sure we can see the name of hte camera 
- finish implementing the show, hide fps, camera and time


UX:
http://alistapart.com/blog/post/designing-social-tools-for-tweens
- make it simple and add rewards ( be positive when publishing or sharing something)
	- try to reduce the projects to a single page experience where once can view all projects and shots at the same time.
- only show many views a movie has	
- only accept people that are logged in to leave a message
- add text documentation
	- maybe add a read more or learn more link to the individual videos/sections?
- simplify the project/shots/versions context
	- replace with was google documents have but allow the use to sort by project
